# 👨‍💻 Paul Lee — Industrial Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio. I'm an Industrial & Systems Engineering student at the University of Washington focused on building high-impact systems that reduce inefficiency, eliminate waste, and scale intelligently. My work blends lean manufacturing, design thinking, and data-backed decision-making.

This portfolio is a behind-the-scenes look at how I solve messy problems, rethink systems, and build things that actually work.
